### Open Set

- [ ] get a lot from open online 2015
- [ ] an option of suggesting a match by the author might be interesting /feasible?
- [ ] As soon as I approved several matches, there is a list of them appear on the left window new my article. But when i click on them, i cannot read the these articles neither their titles. Perhaps would be handy to revisit the choice if there are several of them. 
- [ ] Marked as a match several articles by mistake. Therefore was wondering if it’s possible to come back to the choices and correct the mistake? 

### Open!

- [ ] unclear how the matching works
- [ ] almost don’t find any matches
- [ ] not super convinced about the matches given
- [ ] come across the same non-Open! articles again and again
- [ ] sometimes I know that a specific Open! article that is not in the picture could have been a much better match with a proposed text

### Amateur Cities

- [ ] get a lot from open online 2015
- [ ] I noticed is that sometimes I read an article and it’s not a match for what I am reading but I know another article it’s a match for
- [ ] tempted to search in reverse until I find what I have in mind
- [ ] If you get a recommendation that fits something else you know of, that you can actually make that match yourself
- [ ] had trouble with rating the match. For instance I never used ‘1’ and a match. I would tend to think that it’s not a match then. 
- [ ] might be helpful especially for external testers to make an explanation on roll over or in the users guide what does it mean that I rate a match with a 5, 3 or 1.
- [ ] The issue of different sample sizes is something I noticed as well. I don’t think I got any of the Open Set articles recommended

### Silvio Lorusso

- [x] it would be good to have a call to action when selecting the source, e.g. "Select the source you want to fetch articles from"
- [x] it might be good to have the panels more recognizable/distinct in terms of Publisher, to immediately understand what one is looking at, e.g. instead of having the Publisher expressed textually, having the logo of it
- [x] the double scrolling (which is very nice btw) is bit sloppy on Firefox 71.0
- [x] it might be good to have some reference to the article (such as the title), in the Match tab. For example, "Match suggestion 1: On populism"
- [x] when a match is added and the users clicks on the Match tab all the info (Publisher, Title) are empty
- [x] it might be good to make more evident when new Match suggestions are added, such as a small animation of the new tabs
- [ ] it might be interesting to allow the user to compare the ratings added by other users
